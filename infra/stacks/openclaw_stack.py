        # AGENT TODO: I wanted to start small with the scope of the bot for the
        # sake of getting things working, but now I want to share the bigger
        # picture of how I want this to work.
        # - First, focusing on the setup of the human users. Most of this
        # deployment has been built to automatically set up my own user account,
        # but I also want to add a user account for my partner. I don't think I
        # need to include her account in the authentik blueprints, since I plan
        # on making it for her in authentik by hand. Trying to automate that
        # would complicate the setup we have now with env-var injection; as long
        # as her account isn't lost during redeploys then I'm fine with setting
        # it up manually this one time.
        # - Second, onto agents. I want to have multiple openclaw agents, each
        # tailored for a specific purpose, and I want to use different matrix
        # rooms to talk to them. I want each of those agents to appear as their
        # own matrix username, with separate identities I can address in
        # messages. For the sake of giving practical examples, let's assign some
        # names. My name is Chris, my partner's name is Chelsea, and I have
        # three different AI agents in mind: Wadsworth, Sebastian, and Binx.
        # Each of these three agents are assistants to help keep our daily lives
        # humming along smoothly, but they have different roles.
        #   - Sebastian is my personal assistant, whom I can share sensitive
        #   information with (like planning a surprise for my partner without
        #   worrying about her finding out), assign all sorts of tasks to (like
        #   clean up my email inbox), etc.
        #   - Binx plays that same role for my partner.
        #   - Wadsworth is a shared assistant that both myself and my partner
        #   can talk to and assign tasks to that we don't mind the other
        #   learning about. For example, "plan a game night with the neighbors
        #   that works with our schedules".
        # The rationale behind splitting these roles across agents is to
        # partition information, personas, memory, etc so there's no chance of
        # cross-contamination. My partner and I can build Wadsworth together,
        # but we each retain our own private assistants.
        # I'm worried about the security implications of exposing the control ui
        # for openclaw on the internet (and I won't have much luck getting my
        # partner to connect to tailscale to access it), so I want to use Matrix
        # as the "safe" way to direct these agents (since E2EE in matrix rooms
        # gives me confidence that an external attacker hasn't hacked my matrix
        # server either).
        # I'd like to be able to use matrix rooms in the same way that ai chat
        # interfaces uses separate chats. The agent still has all the project
        # context (the other chats) for reference, but the primary context comes
        # from the chat history in that room specifically. Those rooms can have
        # multiple humans and/or multiple agents in them. For example, I may
        # make a room where I invite both Wadsworth and Sebastian so Sebastian
        # can distill and transfer some bit of relevant information to
        # Wadsworth. Or both Chelsea and I may join a room with Wadsworth where
        # we plan an event.
        # Eventually I'll make many more agents for different purposes, and I'll
        # want to make rooms mixing and matching many of them together. I don't
        # know the full set of agents and rooms I'll want, so I don't think that
        # information belongs encoded in this repo's IAC. Instead, I want the
        # code here to set up the building blocks that can enable this use
        # pattern. Let's brainstorm about what we would need to do to set that
        # up.
        # IgnoreMode.GIT picks up each asset folder's own .gitignore
        # so locally-built node_modules / dist don't bloat the upload
        # and don't ship a stale state pnpm will refuse to overwrite
        # on the EC2 host without a TTY.
